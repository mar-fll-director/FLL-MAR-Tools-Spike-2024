# FLL-MAR-Tools-Spike-2024
This repo will contain updated FLL My Blocks for 2024 Gyro navigation for Spike Prime 3.0 Robots used in FIRST LEGO League Challenge. This version incorporates acceleration fro much better accuracy. This is a project to provide updated pre-packaged, tested and working Spike My Block tools to FLL Challenge teams. 

All the original gyro drive My Blocks have been incorporated into 1. A new presentation will get you started. [Gyro Drive My Blocks 2024 - Primer](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Vga1y9exY-jyWSlCoF_mPb3-asiujL25wlZJDBCBb4c/edit?usp=sharing) will get you started.

I will be updating a longer set of presentations to help COaches and kids understa the math. Actually somewhat easy.

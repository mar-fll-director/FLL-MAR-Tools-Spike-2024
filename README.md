# FLL-MAR-Tools-Spike-2024
This repo will contain updated FLL My Blocks for 2024 Gyro navigation for Spike Prime 3.0 Robots used in FIRST LEGO League Challenge. This version incorporates acceleration fro much better accuracy. This is a project to provide updated pre-packaged, tested and working Spike My Block tools to FLL Challenge teams. 

All the original gyro drive My Blocks have been incorporated into 1. A new presentation will get you started. [Gyro Drive My Blocks 2024 - Primer](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Vga1y9exY-jyWSlCoF_mPb3-asiujL25wlZJDBCBb4c/edit?usp=sharing) will get you started.

I have created a presentation to [Move The Plate](https://midatlanticrobotics.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Gyro-Drive-My-Blocks-Moving-The-Plate.pdf). I decide not to push new code as that would affect your existing projects. This tells you how to modify the existing plate code, create it from scratch and how to copy code between project files. Hope it helps. 

I and still working on a longer set of presentations and videos to help Coaches and students understand the code and the math. It is all about the math.
